# 🎬 YouTube Smart Comment Redesign – Design Forge 2025

This project is a submission for **Design Forge 2025**, focused on reimagining YouTube’s comment section to respond dynamically to what’s happening in the video. It solves the problem statement:  
**"AI-Organized Comment Layer With Real-Time Video Context"** by YouTube India x Techstasy.

---

## 🧠 Concept Overview

We designed a **mobile-first YouTube comment experience** where the visible comment updates dynamically in sync with the video, offering contextually relevant reactions from the community.

Here’s everything introduced and redesigned in this project:

- 🕒 **Scene-based comment syncing**  
  As the video plays, the "Most Relevant" comment updates to match the current scene — making it feel like you're watching with others live.

- 💬 **Live comment integration**  
  Only one comment appears directly under the video at a time, dynamically changing as the video progresses. This avoids clutter and keeps focus on the content.

- 🎭 **Mood tagging system**  
  Comments are tagged with emotional tones like funny, wholesome, shocked, etc., represented with a mood emoji for quick viewer connection.

- 🧠 **AI-curated relevancy**  
  Comments are shown based on timestamp, scene content, and engagement — selected intelligently rather than manually sorted.

- 🔘 **Subtle tagging UI**  
  A smart comment bar shows:  
  - **“Most Relevant”**  
  - **Current timestamp**  
  - **Mood emoji**  
  This helps viewers understand why a particular comment is being shown.

- 🎨 **Native YouTube design language**  
  The redesign retains YouTube’s familiar layout while layering intelligent, interactive features seamlessly into the experience.

This approach transforms comments from background noise into **emotionally resonant, scene-aware companions** to the video — all within a minimal, user-friendly design.

## 🖼 Storyboard Frames (Reference Video)

This is how the most relevant comment picked out by the AI would be seen on full horizontal screen.

## 📱 Dynamic Comment UI Screens

These are the mobile mockups showing how the synced comment system works in real-time, the most relevant comments will be shown in the comment box itself with the overall mood captured in that particular scene.

## 🧠 Smart Features Preview

Two additional screens show the concept of:
- Mood-tagged comments in timeline
- Smart filters
- AI-picked reactions
- In this image yellow shows optimistic comments and blue shows gloomy comments.

## 🔗 Figma Prototypes

We created two separate prototypes to show both content flow and UI interaction:

- 📱 **Mobile UI Interaction (Vertical Screen with Dynamic Comments)**  
  👉 [View Vertical UI Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/vrJyIqP2HhretM1a0C7Clu/Gauri-Jagtap_3?node-id=13-1754&t=nZcIVpEX9mh5HuvX-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1)

- 🎞️ **Storyboard Prototype (Horizontal Video Flow)**  
  👉 [View Horizontal Video Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/vrJyIqP2HhretM1a0C7Clu/Gauri-Jagtap_3?node-id=13-2281&t=4e5q2wlIQHcwMLS7-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=13%3A2268)

Both versions work together to represent how smart comments adapt in real-time — one shows **scene-by-scene story progression**, the other shows **actual UI interaction** in a realistic YouTube-like environment.
